                <li>4 ounces cream cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 lb shredded cheddar cheese (Pre shredded works fine but I recommend block cheese)</li>
                <li>2 lbs boneless chicken </li>
                <li>9oz black beans</li>
                <li>9oz pinto beans</li>
                <li>9oz corn off the cob</li>
                <li>4 20oz cans of your favorite Enchilada Sauce</li>
                <li>2oz Taco Bell brand Taco Seasoning</li>
                <li>30 large tortillas</li>
            </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The night/morning before you are going to serve this dish put together, slow cook the chicken and taco seasoning on low for around 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Drain your chicken and put it into a large pot on low on your stove.</li>
            <li>Mix in the cream cheese in chunks and stir thoroughly. The chicken should breaking apart with little effort. </li>
            <li>Get ready to mix in your fillers, the corn and black and pinto beans. Drain them if necessary!</li>
            <li>As the heat softens the chicken and cream cheese mixture add your beans and corn.</li>
            <li>When the mixture is nice and thick and mixed evenly, prepare your glass cooking pans.</li>
            <li>Pour a small pool of enchilada sauce at the bottom of the bowl to help soften the tortillas as they will be being placed momentarily.</li>
            <li>Begin rolling tortillas by filling them with your enchilada mixture. Dont't bother closing the ends, we aren't making burritos this time.</li>
            <li>Place them adjacent to each other in the pans, if your pan is deep enough feel free to double stack them! Just be sure to generously apply enchilada sauce between the layers!</li>
            <li>Once the pans are filled pour more sauce over the tops and add cheese on top of that.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
